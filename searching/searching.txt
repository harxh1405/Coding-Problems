Binary Search -> needs sorted data points
O(log n)
inbuilt algorithm for binary search:
lower_bound(start pointer/iterator, end pointer/iterator, element to search)-> returns the address
the element being searched otherwise returns the address of the closes higher value. If the value is 
not present and is higher than all the data points, then it returns the last address of the set
for c style arrays use it like,
int *ptr=lower_bound(arr,arr+n,2)

For style containers, use:
int itr=lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),2)
for sets, use lower_bound() like this-> auto it=s.lower_bound(5)
